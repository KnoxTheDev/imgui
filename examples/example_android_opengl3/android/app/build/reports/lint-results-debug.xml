        message="A newer version of org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7 than 1.8.0 is available: 1.9.20"

        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

    <issue
        id="DataExtractionRules"
        severity="Warning"
        message="The attribute `android:allowBackup` is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules` specifying an `@xml` resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher."
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Missing data extraction rules"
        explanation="Before Android 12, the attributes `android:allowBackup` and `android:fullBackupContent` were used to configure all forms of backup, including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.&#xA;&#xA;In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules`, specifying an `@xml` resource that configures which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device transfers, separately. If your `minSdkVersion` supports older versions, you&apos;ll still want to specify an `android:fullBackupContent` resource if the default behavior is not right for your app."

        explanation="You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image (for example `@drawable/icon`)."
